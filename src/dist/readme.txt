MODEL PROJECT
============================

'libs' contains all binary, source and javadoc jar files.
'docs' contains api Javadoc and HTML and PDF reference documentation

See the README at http://github.com/cbeams/model-project-gradle for
complete project information.

3rd party dependencies are not included in this distribution. Users
are strongly recommended to use a build system with dependency
management features and retrieve project artifacts and dependencies
via Maven Cental or the SpringSource repository at
http://repo.springsource.org.  If this is not an option for you, you may
choose to build from source by following the instructions at the link
above. You will find an option there for building a
"dist-with-dependencies" zip archive containing all project artifacts as
well as all 3rd party dependencies (optional and required).
